# TheraBot

**TheraBot** is an empathetic, **RAG-powered therapy-style assistant** that integrates **LangChain**, **FAISS**, and **Google Gemini** models to provide supportive, non-clinical conversations grounded in trusted resources.

The system is designed to **ingest knowledge sources** (PDFs, text, Markdown), **embed them with Gemini embeddings**, and **retrieve relevant context** during conversation to reduce hallucinations. A **FastAPI backend** powers the retrieval and response pipeline, while a **Streamlit frontend** provides a user-friendly chat interface.

To ensure safety, TheraBot includes **crisis keyword detection** and automatically displays **regional helplines** when necessary, making it both helpful and responsible.
